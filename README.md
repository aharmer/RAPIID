# RAPIID
Round Angle Pinned Insect Imaging Device


### Description
RAPIID is a GUI app for controlling and capturing images from a FLIR camera array. Cameras are arranged to capture 360 degree specimen and label images that can then be used for label reconstruction and OCR text extraction at later stages of the pipeline.

### Note
RAPIID is still in early stages of development and may not always work as expected or intended.
